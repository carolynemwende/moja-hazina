          When John Steinbeck accepted his Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, he described the writer’s obligation as “dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.” For some critics, that purpose has obscured Steinbeck’s literary value. He has been characterized variously as an advocate of socialist-style solutions to the depredations of capitalism, a champion of individualism, a dabbler in sociobiology, and a naturalist. <br>

          While evidence for different political and philosophical stances may be culled from Steinbeck’s writings, a reader who stops at this point misses some of the most interesting aspects of his work, including his use of paradox. “Men is supposed to think things out,” insists Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath. “It ought to have some meaning” (p. 55). <br> But in this epic novel, as well as in Of Mice and Men and The Pearl, Steinbeck seems to question whether the mysteries of human existence can ever be fully explained. <br> <br> In these works that span the grim decade from 1937 to 1947, Steinbeck urges the dispossessed to challenge a system that denies them both sustenance and dignity, and to seek the spiritual belonging that enables individuals to achieve their full humanity. So we have the paradox of the author apparently denouncing injustice while also exalting acceptance of the sorrows visited on humanity, whether those sorrows are wrought by nature or by humans themselves.

          Steinbeck’s other notable works of fiction include The Pearl (1947), East of Eden (1952), and The Winter of Our Discontent(1961). He also wrote a memoir of a cross-country trip with his poodle, Travels with Charley in Search of America (1962). Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. He died in New York in 1968. His work stands as testament to his commitment to “celebrate man’s proven capacity for greatness of heart and spirit.”</p>
